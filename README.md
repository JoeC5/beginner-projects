## Learning Data Machine Learning

In March 2024 I started my Machine Learning journey. As part of this journey, and to help with my learning, I am sharing the projects I have (and currently) worked on with the goal of hopefully helping others as they learn. 
This repository will include projects for Python,  Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In most cases I will be using Juyper notebooks. Within each project I aim to include text explaining the code and reasoning behind the code I use. Additonally, I will include a brief description for each project below. 

A bit about me. I spend the first hf on my professional career in financial services within the Capital Markets organization. I pivoted into the tech industry with majority of my roles being "non-techincal" in nature - Business Manager, Marketing, Community Manager, Project manager.
With that said, I did spend a few years on a Developer Advocacy team creating 100 and 200 level technical content for customers.
