## Learning Data Analysis, Data Science, and Machine Learning

In March 2024 I started my Machine Learning journey. As part of this journey, and to help with my learning, I am sharing the projects I have (and currently) worked on with the goal of hopefully helping others as they learn. 
This repository will include projects for Python,  Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In most cases I will be using Juyper notebooks. Within each project I aim to include text explaining the code and reasoning behind the code I use. 

A bit about me. I spent the first half on my professional career in financial services within Capital Markets. I pivoted into the tech industry where majority of my roles have been "non-techincal" in nature - Business Manager, Marketing, Community Manager, Project manager.
With that said, I did spend a few years in a technical role on a Developer Advocacy team creating 100 and 200 level technical content for customers - content was shared through speaking engagements and "how to" articles posted on LikedIn
