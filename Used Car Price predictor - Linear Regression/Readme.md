## Car Price Prediction

In this beginner Data Science/Machine Learning project I leverage a data set (from Kaggle.com) to build a price (MSRP) predictive linear regression model. The project is broken up into two Jupyter/Python notebooks. The Car Price Predictor – EDA notebook walks through my initial exploratory data analysis of the data set. The Car Price Predictor – Linear Regression Model notebook leverages my EDA findings to build two linear regression models. 

Each notebook includes explanations of the code as well as my thoughts on the results. 

Note – For the linear regression model(s) my focus was to use the numeric variables within the data set. I realize this somewhat limits the resulting output of the model as I am not (currently) taking into account variables (specifically “object” data types in the data set) that IMO impact the value of the car.  My plan is to build an updated notebook that will include Encoding techniques that will allow the inclusion of Object data types to be included in the linear regression model. This notebook will be added once completed.
